This is a toy interpreter for brainfuck (in its very early stage)

Run
```bash
stack run -- example.bf
```
or
```bash
nix run "git+https://git.earth2077.fr/leana/hbrainfuck" -- example.bf
```
to see a "hello world" !

You can also pass in another file for it to run.

Thanks to all those people who help me, without you this fun project wouldn't be
possible :)

Have fun !
